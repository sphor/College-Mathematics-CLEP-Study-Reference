## Probaility and Statistics

- permutations and combinations (permutations = used when the order of items matter, combinations = when you want to kno whow many different ways of doing something there are)
- probability 

- mean, median, mode, range
- mean = average (sum of numbers divided by amount of numbers)
- median = middle number once they have been put in numerical order
- mode = number that occurs most often in the list
- range = difference between the largest and smallest values

- standard deviation = statistical value used to determine how spread out the data in a sample are, and how close individual data points are to the mean — or average — value of the sample.

- Get the Mean (Average) of the number set (list of numbers)
- Subtract each number in the set from the Mean (#1 minus Average, #2 minus Average, etc)
- Square each of those numbers
- Average the set of squared numbers (This gets you the Variance)
- Find the square root of the Variance (This gets you the Standard Deviation)

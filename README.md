## Terms and Definitions
**Irrational Number:** A real number that cannot be written as a simple fraction. Irrational means not Rational.

**Prime Number:** A whole number greater than 1 whose only factors are 1 and itself.

**Absolute Value:** The magnitude of a real number without regard to its sign. Can be shown as follows: |-5| (which would be 5)

**Independent event probability multiplication rule (AND):** Multiply everything!
`When Bill makes a sandwich, he may choose from among 3 kinds of rolls, 4 varieties of meat, and 2 types of sliced cheese. If he chooses one roll, one meat, and one cheese, how many different kinds if sandwiches can he make?`
Answer: 24
 - 3x4x2 (multiply everything)

**Square Root:** a number which produces a specified quantity when multiplied by itself. 7 is a square root of 49.

## Probability and Statistics

**Rules of Probabilities** 
1. The probability of any event E, P(E) must be greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 1. 
2. The sum of the probabilities of all outcomes must equal 1

### Conditional Probability Chart
`A bookstore has 900 books in stock, of which 600 are paperback (pb) and 300 are hardcover (hc). All of the books are either fiction (f) or nonfiction (nf). If 525 of the books are nonfiction and 375 of the nonfiction books are paperback, how many of the books are fiction and hardcover?`
Answer: 150

**Explanation:**

We know from the question above the following data:

- 900 total
- 600 pb
- 300 hc
- 525 nf
- 375 nfpb

|      | pb            | hc            | Total |
| ---- | ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| nf   | 375           |               | 525   |
| f    |               |               |       |
| total| 600           | 300           | 900   |


### Permutations and Combinations 
**permutations** 
Used when the order of items matter

**combinations** when you want to know how many different ways of doing something there are 

### Mean, Median, Mode, Range
**mean:** average (sum of numbers divided by amount of numbers)
**median:** middle number once they have been put in numerical order
**mode:** number that occurs most often in the list
**range:** difference between the largest and smallest values

### Standard Deviation
statistical value used to determine how spread out the data in a sample are, and how close individual data points are to the mean, or average value of the sample.

**To get standard deviation:** 
- Get the mean (average) of the number set (list of numbers)
- Subtract each number in the set from the Mean (#1 minus average, #2 minus average, etc)
- Square each of those numbers
- Average the set of squared numbers (this gets you the Variance)
- Find the square root of the Variance

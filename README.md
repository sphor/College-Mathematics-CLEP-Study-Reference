## Terms and Definitions
**Irrational Number**

A real number that cannot be written as a simple fraction. Irrational means not Rational.

**Prime Number**
A whole number greater than 1 whose only factors are 1 and itself.

**Absolute Value**
The magnitude of a real number without regard to its sign. Can be shown as follows: |-5| (which would be 5)

**Independent event probability multiplication rule (AND)**
Multiply everything! Example coming soon (sammiches) 

## Probability and Statistics

**Rules of Probabilities** 
1. The probablity of any event E, P(E) must be greatr than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 1. 
2. The sum of the probablities of all outcomes must equal 1

### permutations and combinations 
**permutations** 
Used when the order of items matter

**combinations** when you want to know how many different ways of doing something there are 

### mean, median, mode, range
**mean:** average (sum of numbers divided by amount of numbers)
**median:** middle number once they have been put in numerical order
**mode:** number that occurs most often in the list
**range:** difference between the largest and smallest values

### standard deviation
statistical value used to determine how spread out the data in a sample are, and how close individual data points are to the mean, or average value of the sample.

**To get standard deviation:** 
- Get the mean (average) of the number set (list of numbers)
- Subtract each number in the set from the Mean (#1 minus average, #2 minus average, etc)
- Square each of those numbers
- Average the set of squared numbers (this gets you the Variance)
- Find the square root of the Variance
